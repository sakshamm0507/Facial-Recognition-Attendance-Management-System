# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-Management-System
It is an attendance management system that uses facial recognition to mark the attendance of a person and it can be customised according to the organizations useage

This project leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to automate attendance management in educational institutions, workplaces, or events. The system uses facial recognition technology to identify individuals in real-time through a webcam or CCTV feed, replacing traditional methods like manual roll calls or RFID cards.
It  uses NLM to record facial data to identify the person and it is quiet accurate so it dosent works for photos.
the record of the attendance is automatically stored and updated in an excel file. 

Its key features include:

Face Detection & Recognition: Accurately identifies and verifies registered users.
Automated Attendance Logging: Records attendance directly into a database with timestamps, reducing manual errors.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple dashboard for administrators to manage user profiles, attendance records, and analytics.
Scalability: Designed to handle multiple users simultaneously, ensuring smooth performance in diverse environments.


The project showcases my expertise in Python, OpenCV, and machine learning frameworks, highlighting the potential of AI in streamlining administrative processes.
